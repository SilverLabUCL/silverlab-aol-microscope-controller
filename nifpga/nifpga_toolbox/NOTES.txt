Most of the work in this folder is based on 
- Peter Fiala code for creating a matlab CAPI (with some modifications to 
  support more features, and have it working with the NI 17 version)
- Clark Gaebel c pipe for fast data acquisition 
  (see https://github.com/cgaebel/pipe). Code was modifed again to adjust
  to our needs. 
- Boris Marin, Geoffrey Evans and Antoine Valera modification of these
  toolboxes for performance and implementation
